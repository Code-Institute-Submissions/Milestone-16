# Milestone project 1

This website was created to advertise a fictional personal training gym.

## The live website can be found here: https://gazmoore100.github.io/Milestone/

### Project aim -

To provide a responsive website where new and existing customers could find out information about the gym and the services it provides. As well as provide an area for existing users to sign in and new customers to sign up. This website adds value to the customer by providing an online presence for the gym to easily display the services they provide. This site also contains contact information and a map for the customer's convenience. This websight also provides a login portal for existing members and a sign up form for potential new members.

### Structure -

The website maintains a consistant structure of navigation bar, social links and footer across all 4 pages. These pages are -

Homepage
Gallery
Members Portal
and registration page

#### Homepage - 

The homepage consists of the bootstrap responsive navigation bar, hero image with company name, bootstrap jumbotron, services section, review section, team profiles and an about section.

#### Gallery -

The gallery page contains the same responsive navigation bar and footer as the hompage as well as a selection of images set out in a gallery format. This was taken from a tutorial on w3schools.com.

#### Members Portal -

The members portal retains the same navigation bar and footer as the previous pages. It also contains a simple login screen for members to access their own area of the site. This sign up page is front end only and the submit button refreshes the form.

#### Registration Form -

The registration page retains the same navigation bar and footer as the previous pages. It contains a simple registration form to capture new client details, this page is again only front end. The submit button refreshes the sign up form.
